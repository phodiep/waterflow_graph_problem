# waterflow_graph_problem

Given a grid with values and a starting point, determine the path of water flow assuming it flows from high to lower valued cells. 
Able to go diagonally.

    0   1   2
0 [ 1 , 2 , 1 ]
1 [ 2 , 3 , 2 ]

example: starting at x=2 y=1... there would only be 1 possible path [2,1] > [2,0]
